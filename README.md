# learning-nodejs

This repo will load a demo app chat client following the learning provided from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-nodejs-developer).

In order to run this repo correctly, you will need to create a new database using [MongoDB Cloud](https://cloud.mongodb.com/), and create a `config.js` in your root directory for the `server.js` to read the connection string. 

Once that is set up, you can install the dependencies, 

```
npm install
```

and run the app

```
npm run start
```
